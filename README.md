# MyFirstMicrogame
My microgame was an FPS game that I made with the help of tutorials on Unity Editor. To start playing it, you must click the play button. It will bring you to the main game. A robot is being controlled by the player, and they are holding a special gun (it looks like it is straight out of a sci-fi movie). The player is supposed to shoot at enemy robots without getting killed by them. There are also floating health regenerators, so if you walk through them, you will regain any lost health. If you die, you can still play the game by clicking the play button, which will eventually show up on your screen.
